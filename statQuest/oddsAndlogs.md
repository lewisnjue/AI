odds and logs-odds are fundamental concept inprobabilistic models, especially in logistic regrssion and classificaiton taks. they bridge teh gap between probabilites and linear models in trasforming bunded probabilites (0 to 1) into unbounded valeus (-inf to +inf)

**odds**

- odds represent the raion of the probability of an event occuring to the probabiity of it not occuring. 

odds = p / 1-p 

where p is the probability of the event.


**log-odds**

log-odds is teh natural logaritm of the odds.

log-odds = log(p/1-p)

also the ligit fuction.


*key properties*

- rage form -inf to +inf 
- symeetry logit(p) = -logit(1-p)

## why use log-odds in machine learning? 

a) linear modeling 
- probabilies(p) are bounded beween 0 and 1 , but linear modesl eg logistic regrssion predict unbounded values.

- solution: model log-odds as linear combination of features:

log(p/1-p) = b0 + b1x1 + ... + bnxn 

this is the logistic regrssion equation. 

b) numerical stabilty
- log-odds avoid division by zero when p = 0 or p =1.

c) interopretabilty 
- coefficients(bi) in logistic regrssin describe how feaure affect the log-odds of the outcome. 


**from log-odds o probability**

the invert os the logit fucntion is he sigmoid(logistic fucntion)

p = 1 / 1+ e^(-log-odds)
this convert model prediction batch to probabites. 

example: 
if a logistic regrssion predicts log-odds = 1.386 
p = 1 / 1 + e^(-1.386) = 0.8 


log-odds and logits are essentially the same concept, but hey are used in slightly different contexts (statitics vs deep learning). here isa clear breakdown.


both represetn teh unbounded, pre-activatio output of a model before being squashed into a probability via the logistic/sigmod funciton. 

mathematically the are identical 

logits = log(p/1-p)

where p is teh probabilty of the postive classs.

when you are converting to probabily in log-odds you will use sigmoid but for logits in deep learning you will use sigmoid for binary or sofamx(muli-class ) and i hope you know what we do in softmax .

# Odds Ratio and Statistical Significance in Machine Learning

## 1. Odds Ratio (OR) Definition
The odds ratio compares the odds of an event between two groups:

For a 2×2 contingency table:

|               | Event Yes | Event No |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Group 1**   | a        | b        |
| **Group 0**   | c        | d        |

## 2. Interpretation
- OR = 1: No association
- OR > 1: Increased odds in Group 1
- OR < 1: Decreased odds in Group 1

## 3. Testing Statistical Significance

### Chi-Squared Test
```python
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
table = [[a, b], [c, d]]
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(table)


from scipy.stats import fisher_exact
odds_ratio, p_value = fisher_exact(table)

import statsmodels.api as sm
model = sm.Logit(y, X).fit()
print(model.summary())  # Look for p-values and ORs (e^coefficients)

R² = 1 - (log likelihood model)/(log likelihood null)

h = 2*arcsin(√p₁) - 2*arcsin(√p₂)

```

**key takeawys**

1. OR quantifiers associated strenght 
2. use chi-squared for large sampels, fishers for small. 
3. logistic regression provides adjusted ORs. 
4. always check confidence intervals.

5. preseudo R^2 gives model fi (but interpret cautionsly)
