## design matrics in linear models 
a desing marix also called a feaure matrix or model matrix is a fundamental structure used to represent the input data for linear models in machine learnign and statistics. it organizes eh predictor variables (features) in a way thtallows efficient computation of the linear relationship with the target variable.

**what is a designmatrix?**

a 2d table where: 
- rows: represetn individual observations 
- columns: represent features , including an optional intecept term . 

notaion: typically denoted as X aorX in bold.

shape: if you ahve n samples and p feauture, he design marix has dimenstion n x p.
