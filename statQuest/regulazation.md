## ridge regression

this model solves a regresion model where the loss funciton is the linear leat square funciton and regularization is givne by the l2-norm. alo known a redge regresionor tikhonov regularization. this estimator has built-in spport for mutlivariance regression ie shape of (n_samples,n_targets)

*key takeaways*

- adds an l2 penalty to shrink coefficeints and prevent overfitting. 
- does not eliminate feaature, inlike lasso.
- useful for multicollinear data and high dimensional problems.
