## TYPES OF ARTIFICAIL INTELLIGENCE 
- artificial narrow intelligence 
- artifiacial general intelligence 
- artifiacial super intelligence

some of the sub branches here are : 
- machine learning -( is a subset of artifiacial intelligence that allows computers 
to learn from data and imporve their perfomance on a specific task without being explicitly 
programmed . intead of being given specific rules , machine learning 
algorithms identify pattersn and rleationships within data to make prediction or decisons)
- key compnents of machine learning : 
    - data : the foundation of mahcine learning its the information used to train the algoritms 
    - algorithm: the output of the learning process, which can be used to make predictions or 
    decisons . 

### TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING 
1 supervesed learning : the algorithm is trained on a dataset with labed examples 
(input and output pairs) . the goal is to learn a mapping fuction that can predict outputs for a new unseen inputs . 
example : regrsssion and classification 
1 unsepervised learning: the algoritm is trained on a dataset without labels. the 
goal is to find patterns or structure wihtin the data . 
example clusterring and dimetntinality reduction 
1 reiforcement learning : the algorithm learns by interacting with an enviroment . 
it receives rewards or penalites based on its action and aims to mazimize its cumulative rewards 
examples : game playing , robotics . 


## DEEP LEARNING : 
deep learning is a subfiled of machine learning that focues on using artificail neurl networks with 
multiple layers to learn cmplex patterns in data . these neurla networks are 
inspired by the structure and fuction of the human brain
