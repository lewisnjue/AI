## TYPES OF ARTIFICAIL INTELLIGENCE 
- artificial narrow intelligence 
- artifiacial general intelligence 
- artifiacial super intelligence

some of the sub branches here are : 
- machine learning -( is a subset of artifiacial intelligence that allows computers 
to learn from data and imporve their perfomance on a specific task without being explicitly 
programmed . intead of being given specific rules , machine learning 
algorithms identify pattersn and rleationships within data to make prediction or decisons)
- key compnents of machine learning : 
    - data : the foundation of mahcine learning its the information used to train the algoritms 
    - algorithm: the output of the learning process, which can be used to make predictions or 
    decisons . 

### TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING 
1 supervesed learning : the algorithm is trained on a dataset with labed examples 
(input and output pairs) . the goal is to learn a mapping fuction that can predict outputs for a new unseen inputs . 
example : regrsssion and classification 
1 unsepervised learning: the algoritm is trained on a dataset without labels. the 
goal is to find patterns or structure wihtin the data . 
example clusterring and dimetntinality reduction 
1 reiforcement learning : the algorithm learns by interacting with an enviroment . 
it receives rewards or penalites based on its action and aims to mazimize its cumulative rewards 
examples : game playing , robotics . 


## DEEP LEARNING : 
deep learning is a subfiled of machine learning that focues on using artificail neurl networks with 
multiple layers to learn cmplex patterns in data . these neurla networks are 
inspired by the structure and fuction of the human brain 
## WHAT IS AI ? 
teh thory and developmen of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requireing human iterlligence such as visual perception , speech recognition, decison making and tranlation between languages 

## TYPES OF AI 

### artivicial narrow intelligence : 

artificial narrow intelligence also know as weak ai involoves applying ai only to specific taks 
## artificial general intelligence : 

artifical general intelligence also know as strong ai , ivolves 
machines that possess teh ability to perfomr any intellectaul task that a human can . 

## artificail super intelligence : 
is a term referring to the time when the capability of computers will supass humans 

## ALORITHM: 
a set of rules and statistical techniues used to learn patterns from data . 
## MODEL : 

a modle is trianed by using a machine learning algoritm . 

## PREDICTOR VAIRIABLE 

it is a feature of the data that can beused to predict the output 

## RESPONSE VARIABLE : 
it is teh feature or the output variable that needs to be predicted by using th predictor varaibles 

## TRAINING DATA  
the machine learning modle is built using the training data . 

## TESTING DATA 
the machine leanring model is evaluted usint the tesint data 

## MACHINE LEARNING PROCESS 

the machine learning process invlolve building  a predictive modle that can be used to find a solution for a problem statment 

## MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEMS 

### REGRESSION 
- supervised learnin g
- ouput is a contious quantity 
- main aim is to forecast or predict 
- eg predict stoack marke price 
- algorithm lenear regression 

### CLASSIFICATION 

- supervised learning 
- output is a categorical quanity 
- main aim is to compute the categoriy of the data 
- eg classfy emails as spam or non-spam 
- algorithm logistic regression 

### CLUSTERING 
- unsupervised learning 
- assigns data points into clusters 
- main aim is to group similar items clusters 
- eg find all transaction which are floudulent in nature 
- algorimt K-means 

## SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS 
- linear regression 
- logistic regression 
- decision tree 
- random forest 
- naive bayes classifier 
- k nearest naighores 
- support vector mahcines 


## LINEAR REGRESSION 

linear regression is a method to predict dependent vairable based on values of independent varaibles . it can be used for the cases where we want to predict some continous quanity . 
- DEPENDENT VARAIBLE (Y):
the response variable whos value needs to be predcited. 
- INDEPENDENT VALIABLE(X):
the predictor varaile used to predict the response varaible
